<h1>Scribe Notes: CS 111 - Lecture 1 (Winter 2015)</h1>

<h3>Magical Grep</h3>

<p>Sample output: </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ ls -l big 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 eggert faculty 9223372036854775000 Oct 6 11:41 big
$ 
</pre>

<p>~10<sup>19</sup> bytes in size</p>

<p>Looking for char 'x' in it:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ grep x big
$ 
</pre>

<p>No matches. Timing it: </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ time grep x big 
real 0m009s
</pre>

<p>Just 9 milliseconds!
For a file that large, this is unreasonable.
10<sup>19</sup> bytes / 10<sup>-2</sup> seconds =&gt; 10<sup>21</sup> bytes/second
 =&gt; 8 * 10<sup>21</sup> bits/second
 =&gt; 8 Zb/second (zettabits/second)</p>

<p><a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/31/">xkcd What If #31</a> asks:
What is the entire bandwidth of the Internet?
The current estimate is 167 Tb/second (terabits/second).
So how we can move data faster? </p>

<p>Here, at UCLA, we have that problem too. Solution:
Use the SneakerNet and move the hard disks physically.
Theoretically, if we use all of the US freight industry (UPS, USPS, FedEx, etc.)
to move a bunch of MicroSD cards, then we can move
0.5 Zb/s. How was grep 16 times faster? It cheated. </p>

<p>The file wasn't actually that big; we pretended to
make it that big and were able to fool all of the standard
Unix utilities. Grep was smarter. It's really saying, "in all of the places
you cheated, there are no x's."</p>

<p>Say we did: </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ echo x &gt;&gt; big</pre>

<p>Then: </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ grep x big    
Binary file 'big' matches
</pre>

<h4>Quotes on Operating Systems: </h4>

<blockquote><p>
"We don't offer a ready-made programme, but an entire operating system."</p><footer>
Marina Weisband, leader of German Pirate Party. <cite>The Economist</cite> 2013-01-15, p. 19 </footer></blockquote>

<p>Operating systems are connected to politics. This was undreamed of before. </p>

<h4>Definition: System</h4>

<p>But what is a system?</p>

<p>We can turn to an Oxford English Dictionary from 1928 to find 
a traditional, pre-computer definition:<br>
I. An organized or connected group of objects.<br>
II. A set of principles, etc., a scheme, method.</p>

<p>Just as interesting is the etymology:<br>
"System" comes from the Greek
σύστημα, (transliterated as "<em>sýstima</em>"), meaning "organized whole,
government, constitution."</p>

<p class="p-indent">The idea of a system is thus ancient. 
Even the roots of <em>sýstima</em> mean "set up with." Marina Weisband in the above 
quote is appealing to this ancient meaning.</p>

<p>Let's see another definition, this one from the course 
textbook (§1.A.2):<br>
"A set of interconnected components that has a
specified behavior observed at the interface with its environment."</p>

<p>Let's move to the modern era by examining the definition 
for "operating system" specifically. From Bill Gates' personal
encyclopedia, Encarta (2007):<br>
"Master control program in a computer."</p>

<p class="p-indent">By this definition, the entity in control is the one 
that matters, a definition fit for Microsoft.</p>

<p>Yet another definition comes from the American Heritage dictionary
(the most conservative dictionary, in its 4th edition from 2000):<br>
"Software designed to control the hardware of a specific 
data-processing system in order to allow users and application 
programs to make use of it."</p>

<p class="p-indent">This is a very traditional definition. It is also obsolete. 
Operating systems are no longer necessarily hardware-specific. 
Even so, users and applications still matter.</p> 

<p>Finally, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operating_system&amp;oldid=640779030">Wikipedia</a> (page id: 640779030, 2015-01-03):<br>
"Software that manages computer hardware and software
resources and provides common services for computer programs."</p>

<p class="p-indent">Note how "control" has become "manage" and the appearance
of "resources." Resource-management will be of great importance.
As for "common services," it comes back to how we implement
that system's interface, e.g. any program can ask the OS to
translate UI text to Spanish for it. We want to avoid duplication.
The overall goal here is <em>clarity</em>, with as few lines of 
code as possible. </p>

The guiding question: <p>"How can we make our systems obvious and clear?"</p>

<h3>Problems in System Design</h3>

<p>Common Systems Problems: </p>

<h4>1. Incommensurate scaling</h4>

<p>This problem is well known in physical engineering designs.
Example: a 12-foot tall human would need a 
modified skeleton; something like stretching in all
3 directions would not work. We'd be 8 times as heavy
and 2 times as tall, but our bone strength
grows as the square of their cross-section. </p>

<p>We are hitting <em>diseconomies of scale</em>, where
things get more expensive per unit. Example:
an 8-port gigabit router is $100, but a 48-port
gigabit router is thousands of dollars. This is because it's a
<em>star network</em> where the number of possible combinations
of connections grows as the square. </p>

<p>Contrast this with <em>economies of scale</em>, as seen in
the pin factory from Adam Smith's <em>Wealth of Nations</em>.
There, we saw how it was more efficient to have someone specialize,
invest capital for equipment, and make
many pins rather than have everyone else produce their own.
We need to account for <em>both</em> of these phenomena 
when we scale our systems. Otherwise, they
cause breakage or waste (e.g., more pins produced than needed). </p>

<h4>2. Emergent properties</h4>

<p>These are properties that only become apparent
<em>qualitatively</em>. "Things just happen" as the system
gets bigger, and we didn't predict them. We're looking
for things that have no effect or may not even exist
at a small scale but that will break our system at large-enough scales.

For example: 20 years ago, UCLA got the latest and fastest
Internet connections. The intended effect: Homework would get done faster.
Instead, students heavily pirated music, this being the age of Napster.
UCLA was swamped with cease-and-desist letters.
At one point, more than 80% of the network traffic was
pirated materials. </p>

<p>Another example: the Tacoma Narrows bridge. Engineers forgot about 
resonant frequencies, in this case from the wind. The bridge
soon collapsed when strong winds swayed it at just the right frequency.
Every civil engineer gets an earful of this now. </p>

<h4>3. Propagation of effects</h4>

<p>Operating systems are digital, not analog.
The smallest thing can make an operating system crash.
Often, we <em>think</em> we have some well-designed OS with boundaries
between components. Effects may still cross boundaries
and wreck things. </p>

<p>Example: A file system takes requests like <code>a:\b\c</code> and gives
you the file: </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ cat a:\b\c
</pre>

<p>Somewhere else, we have an encoding for Japanese characters,
which cannot fit in one byte (more than 256 Japanese characters exist). </p>

<p>So, we decide on a two-byte encoding scheme. 
When the text is ASCII, the top first bit will be 0, and we'll leave
the second byte unused. Japanese will have the top bit be 
1, and the character may use both bytes.
This gives us 2<sup>15</sup> combinations, enough to handle Japanese.
</p>

<p>Say we tried to create a new directory with a Japanese name: </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">$ cp a:\b\c d:[Japanese]
</pre>

<p>But the user gets an error message along the lines of:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">&quot;cannot create directory [Japanese]&quot;
</pre>

<p>What happened? The top bit of the second byte
had a 0, and the rest of it looked like a backslash.
This happened with an early version of Windows.
To fix this, Microsoft had to break down the boundary
between the encoding and the file system and make things
more complicated. </p>

<h4>4. Trade-offs</h4>

<p>We face all the previous problems, and we start trying
to solve them, only to find that that we make other
problems worse. This can be called the "waterbed effect." </p>

<p>Example: sorting algorithms. Bubble sort
is faster than heap sort or mergesort for small-enough datasets,
but doesn't scale the way they do. </p>

<h4>5. Complexity</h4>

<p>This is the problem special to CS. </p>

<p>Consider Moore's Law: Complexity doubles every 18-24 months 
(for the cheapest design point; it doesn’t necessarily hold for more
expensive CPUs). Originally, the law Gordon Moore
formulated referred to the number of transistors on a chip.
Professor Eggert thinks Moore's Law is petering out, but he said
that 10 years ago too. </p>

<p>The main concern: computers are getting more complicated, but
we designers are not becoming much more sophisticated. </p>

<p>Consider also Kryder's Law: Disk drive capacity also 
grows exponentially. Looking back, Professor Eggert's first home computer had
a 1 GB hard drive in 1992 for $1,000. </p>

<p>Looking forward, we need to continue to build systems that work, 
and that we <em>understand</em> despite their immense complexity. 
It will not be an easy task, but it will be a worthwhile one.
